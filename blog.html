            <hr class="border-2 border-blue-500">
            <p class="mt-3">The scope of a variable in JavaScript determines where the variable can be accessed in the code. There are
                three different scopes in JavaScript: <br>
    
                Global scope: The global scope is the outermost scope in a JavaScript program. Variables declared in the
                global scope are accessible from anywhere in the program.<br>
                Function scope: The function scope is the scope of a function. Variables declared in a function's scope are
                only accessible from within that function.<br>
                Block scope: The block scope is the scope of a block of code, such as a if statement or a for loop.
                Variables declared in a block's scope are only accessible from within that block.<br>
                The keywords var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The scope of a variable
                declared with each keyword is as follows:<br>
    
                var: Variables declared with the var keyword are function-scoped. This means that they can be accessed from
                anywhere within the function in which they are declared, as well as from any nested functions.<br>
                let: Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped. This means that they can only be accessed
                from within the block in which they are declared.<br>
                const: Variables declared with the const keyword are also block-scoped, but they cannot be reassigned once
                they are initialized.

       <div class="mt-5 mx-auto shadow-xl w-[50vw] p-7" > <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h3>
        <hr class="border-2 border-blue-500">
        <p class="mt-3">
            The null and undefined values are used in JavaScript to represent the absence of a value.<br>

            Null is used to represent the intentional absence of a value. For example, you might use null to represent a
            missing value in an object or an array.<br>
            Undefined is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. For example, a variable is undefined if
            it has not been assigned a value yet.<br>
            Here are some of the use cases of null and undefined:
            <br>
            To check if a variable has been assigned a value:<br>
            To represent a missing value in an object or array:<br>
            To indicate that an error has occurred:<br>
            To avoid errors when accessing a property that might not exist:<br>
            It is important to use null and undefined correctly in JavaScript. By understanding the difference between
            these two values, you can avoid errors and write more readable and maintainable code.

        <div class="mt-5 mx-auto shadow-md border rounded-lg w-[50vw] p-7"><h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <hr class="border-2 border-blue-500">
            <p class="mt-3">
                A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an application programming
                interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. REST APIs are based on the REST
                architectural style, which defines a set of constraints for how resources are represented and accessed.<br>
    
                The main constraints of REST are:
                <br>
                Resource identification: Every resource in a REST API is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource
                Identifier).<br>
                Resource manipulation: Resources can be manipulated using four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.<br>
                Self-descriptive messages: REST APIs use self-descriptive messages to communicate between the client and the
                server. This means that the messages should be self-explanatory and should not require any additional
                information to be understood.<br>
                Statelessness: REST APIs are stateless. This means that the server does not need to keep track of the state
                of the client. Each request from the client is treated as a separate transaction.<br>
                REST APIs are a popular choice for developing web APIs because they are simple and easy to understand. They
                are also scalable and efficient, making them a good choice for large-scale applications.<br>
    
                Some of the benefits of using REST APIs include:<br>
    
                Simple and easy to understand<br>
                Scalable and efficient<br>
                Platform-independent<br>
                Language-independent<br>
                Well-documented<br>
                Widely supported<br>
                Some of the drawbacks of using REST APIs include:<br>
    
                Can be complex to implement<br>
                Not as secure as some other APIs<br>
                Can be difficult to debug<br>
                Overall, REST APIs are a powerful tool that can be used to develop efficient and scalable web applications.
